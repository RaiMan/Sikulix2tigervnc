# Sikulix2tigervnc [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RaiMan/Sikulix2tigervnc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RaiMan/Sikulix2tigervnc)

special setup of TigerVNC to be used in SikuliX2

**Be aware:**
 
Internally the sources of [TigerVNC version 1.7.1](https://github.com/TigerVNC/tigervnc) are used. 
This makes it necessary, to set this package under the **license type GPL 2**.

This means, if you use this feature together with SikuliX, 
then **no longer the MIT license** of SikuliX applies, **but GPL 2** for the whole package
and possible works you build on top. 

This has no effect, as long as you keep SikuliX 
and your works in your private use. 

But **if you distribute** the whole package including 
this VNC feature or your works based on this whole package,
 then you **must obey the rules of GPL 2**.
